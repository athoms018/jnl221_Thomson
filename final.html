			<p id="with-element">When you walk into almost any retail store, one of the most common names in clothing on the shelves is NIKE. While NIKE is heavily known for its innovative athletic gear, they are also known for something less appealing. Many consumers while purchasing these products don’t consider how or where these products are manufactured. The outsourcing of labor has become a serious problem in the manufacturing of valuable apparel brands.</p>
			<p>Outsourcing of labor is characterized by businesses or in this case multinational corporations bringing in third parties to perform services. These services would typically be performed in-house by employees of the business. Instead, these third parties are typically headquartered non-domestically to minimize labor and production costs. Typically, the countries where these third-party contractors are located unanimously have lower working and wage standards. These lower standards allow for in some cases forced labor, wage theft, etc… NIKE as a company pushes for wage and labor justice but is able to escape the limelight domestically because a majority of its products are manufactured outside of the United States. </p>

			<h3>Where is NIKE Outsourcing?</h3>
			<p>Annually, NIKE Inc. releases a manufacturing map that highlights all of the independent NIKE factories, what these facilities produce and material suppliers for the factories. The data additionally shows the number of employees per factory. After analysis of the 2022 data, it is shown by the below data visualization that Vietnam had the highest number of NIKE factory employees with just over 515,000 employees. This is followed by Indonesia with roughly 212,000, followed by China with about 104,000. The United States ranked just shy of 20th place in terms of the total number of employees.</p>

			<p>Another finding from the NIKE manufacturing map is the breakdown of total employees per global region in which manufacturing factories are located. This helps convey further just where NIKE is outsourcing labor. The highest employee population is in South East Asia with nearly 650,000 employees. Both data visualizations are shown below.</p>

			<h3>What are the Implications of Outsourcing Labor? </h3>
			<p id="with-element">Outsourcing labor has a few implications that range from quality control to human rights violations. While NIKE has been responsible for revolutionary advances in footwear and athletic gear, outsourcing labor can have serious implications on the quality of products. When these third parties take over manufacturing the main goal is quantity over quality. Outsourcing labor allows NIKE to have a low cost of labor and materials. Overall, this allows NIKE to sell its products at a low cost that is competitive with other brands with similar practices. This mass production results in a lower standard of quality of products. Online clothing and shoe salesman Brandon Leet has been buying and selling clothing online since 2018. Over the years Leet has found a connection between apparel companies that outsource labor and quality.</p>
			<div id="list">
				<h4>Outsourcing Causes:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Human Rights Violations</li>
					<li>Lower Accountability for the apperal brand</li>
					<li>A reduction in product quality due to lower standards across the board</li>
					
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p id="with-element">“Not just NIKE but across the board, I know quantity over quality when I see it. Most of these clothing companies have resorted to this and when some of my shoes wear out after a few years of light use it's evident where priorities and standards have gone” Leet said.</p>

			<p id="with-element">A more serious implication of outsourcing labor is the human rights violations that take place within these factories. Often there is lower accountability for labor and wage violations within these facilities. Employees can be overworked and underpaid but because these factories are independent under third-party contractors, NIKE is able to escape the limelight because the owner doesn’t fall under them. In their 2019 article entitled “Confronting the Root Causes of Forced Labour: Outsourcing,” OpenDemocracy states “In these industries, where there is intense pressure to keep labor costs low, there is both pressures towards informality and to over-work and under-pay informal, contracted workers.” The quantity over quality mentality has overall put pressure informality on and held factories accountable for violations. Furthermore, there is pressure to keep labor costs low to turn the most profits, all of which causes human rights violations to thousands of workers across the globe. </p>

			<h3> What can be done about this? </h3>
			<p>Within the last decade, NIKE has been under fire for being passive in the wake of human rights crises. Several instances in China and Vietnam have been compared to sweatshops and major protests in these countries occurred. A solution to this problem is complicated and multi-faceted.</p>
			<p>A step to solving this accountability issue is by building domestic NIKE manufacturing factories. Starting to manufacture products domestically will not only provide a wave of jobs to different areas of the United States but will limit the amount of labor that will need to be outsourced. By mitigating non-domestic labor, fewer human rights violations like those in China and Vietnam will occur. Aside from better labor standards, the quantity-over-quality mentality will begin to loosen because employees will not be overworked and underpaid. Bringing issues like these to light is all part of a greater effort to provide an honest, ethical, and overall sustainable supply chain.</p>
